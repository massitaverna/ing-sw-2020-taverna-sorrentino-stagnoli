# ing-sw-2020-taverna-sorrentino-stagnoli

Software Engineering Project | A.A. 2019 - 2020 | GC6

## Functionalities

In our project we implemented:

- Complete Rules
- CLI
- GUI
- Socket
- 2 Advanced functionalities

The advanced functionalities we decided to implement allow the software to handle multiple games at the same times and you can play with 5 advanced gods. Theese new deities are Zeus, Era

## Test Coverage

| Model   |   100%   |

## Prerequisites

In order to use this piece of software it is required that you have **Maven** and **Java** installed. You can download both using the following links:

- Maven (3.6.3): https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
- Java (JDK 14.0.1): https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk14-archive-downloads.html

To install Maven follow this [guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) on their site.

## How to use this software

### Generate the Jar

To run this piece of software you'll need to generate a .jar file. After you've cloned this repository make sure you are in the main directory called _"ing-sw-2020-taverna-sorrentino-stagnoli"_. Open your terminal in this position and type the following commands (it's the same for all operating system).

This is just a good practice to make sure it's a clean generation

```shell
mvn clean
```

This is the actual command that will generate the jar file

```shell
mvn package shade:shade
```

After the jar is created you'll need to change directory into the _"target"_ folder. Simply type

```shell
cd target
```

Now you should see something like this:
![target_folder]

### Run the server

### Run the client
